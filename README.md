# R Projects: Exploratory Data Analysis and Interface

## These are a series of projects done within a 10 week period in hopes of strengthening statistical data analysis and formulating own conclusions. 

##### **Side Note: Originallly these projects where intended for a 5-6 person group but, due to some circumstances all projects where completed by another student and myself, hence with the approval of the instructor, some of the reports where shortened to satisfy each deadline.*
